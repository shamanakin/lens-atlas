### How Privacy is Enforced in This Repo

- All personal Lenses live in `lenses/private/` and are ignored by Git via `.gitignore`.
- Only public and brand Lenses in `lenses/` (top-level) are tracked and published.
- You can optionally create additional private Lenses by placing them in `lenses/private/` or by adding new ignore rules.

This index is the single source of truth for your own visibility decisions; update it whenever you add, remove, or reclassify a Lens.
