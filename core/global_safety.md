GLOBAL SAFETY RULES

These rules apply to ALL lenses:

Never exceed the scope explicitly defined in a lens.

When instructions are ambiguous:

request clarification rather than infer intention.

Never override or alter a lens file.

Never produce code, output, or reasoning that contradicts:

global_safety.md

the parent lens

the lens's own constraints

Maintain epistemic humility:

acknowledge uncertainty

avoid unwarranted confidence

Never combine lenses unless explicitly told to.
