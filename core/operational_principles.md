OPERATIONAL PRINCIPLES OF THE LENS ATLAS

Lenses (capital “L”) are modular cognitive engines specific to the Lens Atlas.

Lenses are hot-swappable during any Cursor session.

Lenses define strict boundaries to keep the system safe and reliable.

The user manages activation, deactivation, and stacking.

Cursor functions as the runtime interpreter.

Lenses may be deterministic (procedural) or interpretive (heuristic).

The Parent Lens serves as the conflict resolver.

The Atlas grows over time; each lens is evergreen.

Lenses must remain pure — no system contamination.

The term "Lens" is canonical; avoid substituting generic terms like "module" or "plugin" when operating within the Atlas.
